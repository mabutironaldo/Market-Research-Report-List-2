<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Filtration Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Granular Activated Carbon</li><li>Block Carbon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon filtration systems are used to remove impurities and contaminants from water. Two types of carbon filtration systems are commonly used: granular activated carbon (GAC) and block carbon. GAC systems consist of tiny carbon particles that attract and adsorb contaminants, while block carbon systems contain compressed carbon blocks that remove impurities as water flows through. Both types effectively filter out chemicals, chlorine, sediment, and bad odors, providing clean and purified water. The choice between GAC and block carbon depends on specific filtration needs and the water source.</p></p>
