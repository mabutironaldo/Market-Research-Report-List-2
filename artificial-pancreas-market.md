<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Pancreas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CTR System</li><li>CTT System</li><li>Threshold Suspended Device System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Artificial Pancreas Market includes three types of systems: CTR System, CTT System, and Threshold Suspended Device System. The CTR System continuously measures glucose levels and delivers insulin accordingly, promoting more precise control of blood sugar. The CTT System, on the other hand, adjusts insulin dosages based on glucose trends rather than specific glucose levels, enhancing flexibility in diabetes management. The Threshold Suspended Device System suspends insulin delivery when glucose levels fall below a pre-set threshold, preventing hypoglycemia. These systems aim to improve the management of diabetes and enhance the quality of life for patients.</p></p>
