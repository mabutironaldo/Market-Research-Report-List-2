<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Facade Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventilated Facade Systems</li><li>Non-Ventilated Facade Systems</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Facade systems are an important aspect of building construction, providing both functional and aesthetic benefits. Ventilated facade systems involve an external cladding attached to a building's structural framework, with an air gap in between. This allows for natural air circulation and thermal insulation. On the other hand, non-ventilated facade systems are often used in high-rise buildings, where insulation and energy efficiency are prioritized. These systems comprise a tightly sealed cladding system, preventing air movement but providing effective insulation. Both types of facade systems cater to different construction needs and offer distinct advantages.</p></p>
