<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radial Piston Hydraulic Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>MultipleDisplacements</li><li>SingleDisplacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial piston hydraulic motors are classified into two types: multiple displacements and single displacement. Multiple displacements motors allow for adjustable speed and torque output by changing the number of pistons engaged. This flexibility makes them suitable for applications where variable power is required. On the other hand, single displacement motors have a fixed number of pistons and provide constant torque and speed output. These motors are commonly used in applications where consistent power output is needed. Both types of motors have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
