<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NOx Adsorbers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active NOx Adsorbers</li><li>Passive NOx Adsorbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>NOx adsorbers are emission control devices used in vehicles to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Active NOx adsorbers actively manage the reduction process by using a fuel additive or a separate burner to enhance the adsorption and desorption of NOx from the catalyst. Passive NOx adsorbers, on the other hand, rely on the natural heat generated by the engine to trigger the NOx adsorption and regeneration cycle. Both types of NOx adsorbers help in meeting emission standards and improving air quality.</p></p>
