<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dynamic Balancing Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Balancing Valves</li><li>Automatic Balancing Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dynamic balancing valve market includes two types: Manual Balancing Valves and Automatic Balancing Valves. Manual Balancing Valves require manual adjustment to regulate the flow of water in HVAC systems, ensuring optimal balancing. They are less costly but require periodic adjustments. On the other hand, Automatic Balancing Valves use a self-regulating mechanism that adjusts the valve based on the flow conditions. Although more expensive, they offer the advantage of constant automatic balancing, resulting in improved system efficiency and reduced maintenance requirements.</p></p>
