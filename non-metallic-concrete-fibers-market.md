<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-metallic Concrete Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Macro-Synthetic Fibers</li><li>Micro-Synthetic Fibers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Non-metallic concrete fibers are reinforcing materials that are added to concrete to enhance its strength, durability, and resistance to cracking. There are two types of non-metallic concrete fibers: macro-synthetic fibers and micro-synthetic fibers. Macro-synthetic fibers are larger in size and are typically made of materials such as polypropylene or polyethylene. They provide increased tensile strength and impact resistance to concrete. On the other hand, micro-synthetic fibers are smaller in size and made of materials like nylon or polypropylene. They enhance the durability of the concrete by reducing shrinkage and cracking.</p></p>
