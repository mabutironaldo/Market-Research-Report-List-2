<p><p>Gene therapy for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a promising treatment approach that aims to treat the underlying genetic mutations that contribute to the development of the disease. AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults, and currently available treatments mainly focus on managing the symptoms rather than addressing the root cause.</p><p>Gene therapy involves the delivery of healthy genes into the retina to compensate for the malfunctioning genes responsible for the development of AMD. The therapy can be delivered using viral vectors that carry the corrective genes into the cells of the retina. Once inside the cells, these genes produce functional proteins that help restore the normal functioning of the retina and halt the progression of AMD.</p><p>The gene therapy for AMD market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years. Factors driving the market growth include increasing prevalence of AMD globally, advancements in gene therapy technologies, and growing investments in research and development activities. Additionally, the growing geriatric population, who are more susceptible to AMD, is also expected to contribute to market growth.</p><p>The market is also witnessing several trends that are shaping its growth. Personalized medicine and precision therapies are gaining traction, as they allow for targeted treatment strategies based on an individual's genetic profile. This approach could provide better treatment outcomes for AMD patients. Furthermore, ongoing clinical trials for gene therapy for AMD are expected to bring forth more treatment options, which will further contribute to market growth.</p><p>In conclusion, the gene therapy for age-related macular degeneration market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.8% during the forecast period. Advancements in gene therapy technologies, increasing prevalence of AMD, and growing investments in research and development activities are the key drivers of market growth. Personalized medicine and ongoing clinical trials are also shaping the market trends.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy for Age-related Macular Degeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Subretinal</li><li>Intravitreal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) refers to the utilization of gene delivery systems to treat this eye disease. There are two main market types for gene therapy in AMD: subretinal and intravitreal. In the subretinal approach, the therapeutic genes are delivered beneath the retina to target specific cells and restore their normal function. In the intravitreal approach, the therapeutic genes are injected directly into the vitreous fluid of the eye, aiming to target cells within the retina. Both market types aim to improve the symptoms and halt the progression of AMD.</p></p>
