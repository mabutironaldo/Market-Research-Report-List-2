<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Pipeline Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission</li><li>Distribution</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas pipeline infrastructure refers to the networks of pipes that transport natural gas from production sites to consumers. Transmission pipelines are high-capacity systems that transport gas over long distances, connecting production and distribution areas. Distribution pipelines, on the other hand, deliver gas to end-users such as residential, commercial, and industrial facilities within a specific region. While transmission pipelines focus on long-distance transportation, distribution pipelines focus on the final delivery of gas to meet local demand. Both types of infrastructure are vital for ensuring a steady supply of natural gas to consumers.</p></p>
