<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Dental Handpiece Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brush Motor</li><li>Brushless Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric dental handpiece market can be categorized into two types: brush motor and brushless motor. In brush motor handpieces, the rotation is achieved through the interaction of brushes and a commutator. This design is cost-effective but can cause friction and wear, leading to potential maintenance issues. On the other hand, brushless motor handpieces use electronic control to achieve rotation, eliminating the need for brushes and improving overall performance and durability. While brush motor handpieces are more common due to their lower cost, brushless motor handpieces are gaining popularity for their superior efficiency and longevity.</p></p>
