<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Electrostatic Precipitator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed-Electrode</li><li>Moving-Electrode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dry electrostatic precipitator market includes two types: fixed-electrode and moving-electrode. In a fixed-electrode system, the electrodes are stationary, while the particles are charged and collected as they pass through the electric field. This type is commonly used for large-scale industrial applications. On the other hand, a moving-electrode system involves electrodes that are designed to move, enabling a more efficient collection of particles. This type is often utilized in smaller-scale applications where space is limited. Both types aid in removing pollutants from gas streams through electrostatic forces.</p></p>
