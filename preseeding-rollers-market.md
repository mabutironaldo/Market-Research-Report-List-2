<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Preseeding Rollers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-propelled</li><li>Towed</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Preseeding rollers are used in agricultural practices to prepare the soil before planting seeds. Self-propelled rollers are equipped with their own power source, allowing them to move and operate independently. Towed rollers, on the other hand, are pulled by another vehicle or tractor. Both types are commonly used in farming to compress the soil, remove air pockets, and create a smooth and level surface for seed planting. Self-propelled rollers provide greater maneuverability and flexibility, while towed rollers are more economical and suitable for larger areas of land.</p></p>
