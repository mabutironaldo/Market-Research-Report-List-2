<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraoral Digital Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCD Sensor</li><li>CMOS Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intraoral digital cameras are widely used in the dental field for capturing images of a patient's oral cavity. There are two main types of sensors used in these cameras: CCD sensors and CMOS sensors. CCD sensors, or Charge-Coupled Devices, are highly sensitive and produce high-quality images with low noise levels. On the other hand, CMOS sensors, or Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor, are more cost-effective and consume less power, while still delivering decent image quality. Both sensor types have their advantages and are used in different intraoral digital camera models based on the specific requirements of dental professionals.</p></p>
