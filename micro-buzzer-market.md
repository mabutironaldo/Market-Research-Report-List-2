<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micro Buzzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Buzzer</li><li>Electromechanical Buzzer</li><li>Piezoelectric Buzzer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The micro buzzer market consists of three main types: mechanical buzzer, electromechanical buzzer, and piezoelectric buzzer. Mechanical buzzers produce sound using a metal or plastic diaphragm that vibrates when an electric current flows through it. Electromechanical buzzers have a coil and a magnet that create sound when the coil moves the diaphragm. Piezoelectric buzzers use a piezoelectric ceramic material that vibrates when an electric current is applied to generate sound. These buzzers find applications in various electronic devices and systems requiring audible alerts or notifications.</p></p>
