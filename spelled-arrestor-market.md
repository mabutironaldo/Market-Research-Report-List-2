<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spelled Arrestor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-line</li><li>End-of-line</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spelled Arrestor is a device used to prevent the propagation of sparks and flames in ductwork systems. There are two types of market for Spelled Arrestors: In-line and End-of-line. In-line Spelled Arrestors are installed within the ductwork and provide continuous protection by stopping sparks and flames before they spread further. On the other hand, End-of-line Spelled Arrestors are placed at the end of the ductwork system and act as a final barrier against any sparks or flames that might have made it through the ductwork. Both types offer effective fire prevention in different parts of the ductwork system.</p></p>
