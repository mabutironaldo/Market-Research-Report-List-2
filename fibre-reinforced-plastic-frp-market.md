<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PAN-Based</li><li>Pitch-Based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP) is a composite material made by reinforcing a polymer matrix with fibres. There are two main types: PAN-Based and Pitch-Based. PAN-Based FRP is produced from a polyacrylonitrile precursor, which is cheaper and easier to handle during production. On the other hand, Pitch-Based FRP is derived from coal tar pitch, resulting in a higher carbon yield and greater heat resistance. Both types offer unique properties suitable for various applications, such as aerospace, automotive, construction, and sports equipment.</p></p>
