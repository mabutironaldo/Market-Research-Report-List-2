<p><strong>The Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Petroleum Cracking Method</li><li>Gas Purification Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a widely used fuel derived from petroleum. There are two main methods of producing LPG in the market: the Petroleum Cracking Method and the Gas Purification Method. </p><p>The Petroleum Cracking Method involves the refining of crude oil through a process called cracking, where heavier petroleum fractions are heated, causing them to break down into lighter fractions, including LPG. This method is commonly used in oil refineries.</p><p>The Gas Purification Method involves the extraction of LPG from natural gas through a process called fractionation. Natural gas contains various hydrocarbons, and these are separated by cooling and compressing the gas, resulting in LPG as one of the fractions.</p><p>Both methods produce LPG, which is then stored and transported in its liquid form for various applications, including cooking, heating, and powering vehicles.</p></p>
