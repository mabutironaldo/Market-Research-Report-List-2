<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Precision Guided Missiles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autonomous</li><li>Semi-autonomous</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Precision guided missiles are advanced weapons used in modern warfare to precisely target and destroy specific enemy targets. They can be categorized into two types: autonomous and semi-autonomous. Autonomous missiles are fully self-guided and require no human intervention during flight, relying on onboard sensors and algorithms to navigate and hit their targets. On the other hand, semi-autonomous missiles require some level of human control and intervention, as they depend on initial target designation from a remote operator or sensor and then navigate autonomously towards the target. Both types significantly enhance precision and minimize collateral damage.</p></p>
