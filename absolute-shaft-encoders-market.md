<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absolute Shaft Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Turn</li><li>Single-Turn</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Absolute shaft encoders are used to measure the position of rotating machinery or devices. They are differentiated based on their ability to measure rotations. Single-turn encoders are capable of measuring a complete rotation, providing position information within a 360-degree range. Multi-turn encoders, on the other hand, can measure multiple rotations, giving position information in both the 360-degree range and the number of turns completed. This enables multi-turn encoders to accurately track the position even after several rotations, making them suitable for applications requiring precise positioning information over extended periods.</p></p>
