<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulose Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nitrocellulose Coatings</li><li>Cellulose Acetate Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cellulose coatings encompass two main types: nitrocellulose coatings and cellulose acetate coatings. Nitrocellulose coatings are made by dissolving nitrocellulose in a mixture of solvents, resins, and plasticizers. These coatings provide excellent resistance to wear, chemicals, and abrasion while maintaining a glossy appearance. On the other hand, cellulose acetate coatings are derived from cellulose acetate, a thermoplastic made by acetylating cellulose. These coatings are known for their high transparency, resistance to UV light, and ability to enhance the appearance of substrates through gloss and high clarity finishes.</p></p>
