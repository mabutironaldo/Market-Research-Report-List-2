<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Valve Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heart Valve Replacement Devices</li><li>Heart Valve Repair Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart valve device market consists of two main types: heart valve replacement devices and heart valve repair devices. Heart valve replacement devices involve the complete removal of the diseased valve and its replacement with an artificial valve. On the other hand, heart valve repair devices are used to treat the existing valve by repairing or remodeling it, rather than replacing it entirely. Both types of devices aim to restore normal blood flow through the heart and improve overall cardiac function.</p></p>
